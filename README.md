# job-distributor: Lightweight Job Distribution Framework

**job-distributor** is a lightweight framework for running thousands of parameterized jobs or simulations in parallel. It is designed for research experiments where outcomes depend on specific parameter combinations, and the objective is to identify the best setup based on metrics such as accuracy, performance, or efficiency.

## Example Use Case: MNIST Hyperparameter Tuning

To showcase how this framework works, we applied it to a classic machine learning task: hyperparameter tuning for a handwritten digit classifier using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to evaluate various combinations of hyperparameters and find the best-performing configuration.
