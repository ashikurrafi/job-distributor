# job-distributor

**job-distributor** is a lightweight framework for running thousands of parameterized jobs or simulations in parallel. It is designed for research experiments where outcomes depend on specific parameter combinations, and the objective is to identify the best setup based on metrics such as accuracy, performance, or efficiency.

## Example Use Case: MNIST Hyperparameter Tuning

To showcase how this framework works, we applied it to a classic machine learning task: hyperparameter tuning for a handwritten digit classifier using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to evaluate various combinations of hyperparameters and find the best-performing configuration. For a clearer understanding of the research task, visit: [MNIST-parameter-tuning](https://github.com/NWSL-UCF/MNIST-parameter-tuning)

## Setup Overview

To use the **job-distributor** framework, follow these two main steps:

1. **Start the Server** 

   The server is responsible for managing the job queue and tracking the status of each job (e.g., pending, running, completed). [Learn how to set up the server independently](/server/README.md)

2. **Configure the Clients (Worker Machines)**  
   
   The client-side code runs on each worker machine where the actual jobs will execute. Each client contacts the server to fetch an unassigned job (such as a specific hyperparameter combination), runs the task, and then reports the result back to the server.

Make sure the server is set up and running before launching any clients.
